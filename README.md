# Morse-Code-Node
My first program with sockets in JavaScript (Warning: extremely buggy)

---

## Usage:

```nodejs index.js```

To run server on port 8080

Connect to server using a web browser and morse away!

Test with multiple windows, or something!

Connect multiple clients!

It's a morse party!
